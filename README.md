# Juba
Light-weight nitro sniper, written in Python.
## Installation
Run the `install.bat` file which I made for easier installation, and after that try running `start.bat`
## Configuration
Juba allows you to change your token, and the theme of it. Open the `config.json` file, and edit the `token`, and maybe the `color` as well.
